Following the Python quickstart for Heroku
Using the guide found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction), set up a sample Python web app.

## Opinion
I have deployed web apps via Google App Engine and AWS.  Heroku is a platform as a service, similar to Google App Engine.  Heroku's quickstart documentation and CLI tools felt much snappier than Google App Engine.  If choosing to use a PaaS for a CD pipeline Heroku would be my choice.
